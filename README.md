# Binary_Fun
Using data structures to store in a binary file different information about people who work, such as their identifier, name, job position and salary.
Once you finish storing your data the system encrypts it by transforming the readable datas into binary so that nobody can view your data.
I added two programs, the first one creats the binary file and stores your data and the other one creates a text file for your data.
